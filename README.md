## Overview

* Registration module provides a desktop application for Registration Officers/Supervisors to register an individual in MOSIP by capturing the demographic and biometric details of an individual.
* Registration module uses data captured by `Pre-Registration` module if an individual has booked for an appointment in the registration centre.
* Registration Processor processes the data captured by Registration Client module to complete the registration process.
